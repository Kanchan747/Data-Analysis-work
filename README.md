My First A/B testing Project is successfully completed and it is named as "Testing.docx" 
Welcome to my **Data Analysis Work** repository!  
This space contains practical analyses, exploratory data insights, and statistical testing exercises—including A/B testing—done using Python and real-world datasets.

 Overview

This repository includes:

-  **A/B Testing Analysis**
  - Univariate statistics on 'total ads'
  - Quartile segmentation and distribution insights
  - Business implications based on user ad exposure

-  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Summary statistics
  - Data cleaning steps
  - Visualizations and interpretation

-  **Statistical Testing**
  - Levene’s Test for equal variances
  - t-tests and significance interpretation
  - Distribution comparisons
** Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- SciPy / Statsmodels
- Jupyter Notebook
- Results & Impact:**
  - Discovered a right-skewed distribution (median = 8, mean ≈ 9.8).
  - Identified the 75th percentile cap (27 ads) to segment user cohorts.
  - Informed recommendations: ad capping policies, user segmentation, monitoring outliers.
